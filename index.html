    <!-- About -->

    <!-- <p class="about-p">My name is Adam. I currently reside in Indianapolis, IN. I graduated from Purdue University
      (Fort Wayne) in 2012 with a degree in Organizational Leadership and Supervision. Since that time I have held
      various service roles in business-to-business organizations. I have experience in building relationships,
      helping clients implament best practices, troubleshoot technical issues, and leading teams.<br><br>Problem
      solving has been at the core of all of my roles. In my previous roles I have needed to understand the business
      of my clients in order to help them get the most out of the software and services I supported. In my current
      role I am faced with more technical problems. I am tasked with finding the root cause, frequency, and revenue
      impact so development resources can be prioritized appropriately. This has required me to learn SQL to ensure
      I gather the necessary facts. These roles have inspired me to learn how to code as I view developers as the
      ultimate problem solvers.<br><br>In 2020, I made the decision to focus on learning how to code and transition
      to a career as a developer. I began the Web Development course through the Eleven Fifty Academy in May, 2020.
